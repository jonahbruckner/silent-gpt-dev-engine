\# How the SilentGPT Dev Engine works



This page will briefly explain how the engine runs on autopilot:



1\. \*\*Harvest:\*\* The engine collects fresh dev questions and issues from selected sources.

2\. \*\*Generate:\*\* LLM workers draft answers, micro-tutorials and code snippets.

3\. \*\*Review \& filter:\*\* Low-quality or duplicate content is filtered out.

4\. \*\*Publish:\*\* Approved articles are written to Markdown and automatically deployed to the blog.

5\. \*\*Monetize:\*\* High-value articles are bundled into product packs that are sold via Stripe.
