# AI & RAG Troubleshooting Pack #1

This pack gives you a focused collection of real-world RAG issues and their fixes.  
You’ll learn how to tune embeddings, vector search, context windows and prompting to get stable answers instead of random hallucinations.  
Ideal if you work on production-adjacent RAG pipelines and want to save time instead of trial-and-error debugging.
